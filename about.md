I studied Computer Science with an emphasis in game design at the University of Utah. 
My favorite class was Video-Game Story Telling because it made me rethink the way we interact with games.
I want to make games that push the ways people engage with the medium;
whether it be giving you a different perspective or creating unique scenarios in multiplayer games.

Even then it's still a scary industry to break into. 
I wan't sure if I should try until I had an experience play testing a multiplayer game I made with friends.
Hearing people laugh and have so much fun with something you created is unlike any experience I've ever had.
I had never felt that way about anything until then and now I want to create bigger and bigger things!

I also have a lot of love for music and drawing but I'm not quite as good at them.
Here's my favorite drawing I've done!
