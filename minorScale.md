Minor Scale is a rhythm-based tower defense game where the notes on the music control which tower fires. It was developed in Unreal 5 alongside over 20 people for our senior capstone project.

I developed a system for creating and editing the beatmaps. Since our team made all the songs for the game I used the midi files to serve as the basis for the beatmaps and choosing what types of notes were in the game while allowing anybody making music to easily edit the levels.

I led the environmental art team, creating 3D models and textures for all of the maps. 

Early on the game struggled with finding a good difficulty balance between the tower defense sections and rhythm sections. Trying to combine games of two different genres proved to be very challenging so play testing the game as early as we could and as often was very important. I oversaw many of the play-testing sessions, gathering player feedback and making notes for what we needed to work on.
